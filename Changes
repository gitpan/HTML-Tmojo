changes:

	- Fixed type-os in documentation
	
	- Updated non-existant test file so it will work...
	ugh!

version: 0.261
date:    Mar 16, 2004
author:  Will Conant <will@lab-01.com>
changes:

	- Tmojo will report an error if you have a circular
	@TMOJO_ISA reference (i.e. a template that is its
	own parent)

version: 0.260
date:    Mar 14, 2004
author:  Will Conant <will@lab-01.com>
changes:

	- Abstracted the loading of templates into a TemplateLoader
	class. This allows you to create your own TemplateLoader
	that loads templates from someplace other than the disk
	(like a database).
	
	- Added tmojo_lite... templates that can't contain any
	Perl code (in case you don't trust your content providers)
	
	- moved Tmojo into the HTML:: nameespace
	
	- moved Tmojo::Engine.pm back to Tmojo.pm, so, now, the
	module is HTML::Tmojo.pm

version: 0.251
date:    Mar 11, 2004
author:  Will Conant <will@lab-01.com>
changes:

	- Tmojo manually sets $/ (just in case someone else
	in mod_perl land changed it.
	
	- Tmojo will report an error if you have a container
	contained by itself (or any other circular reference)
	
	- we now support '../' at the beginning of template
	ids, so you can back up directories. This is really
	usefull for this: '../container.tmojo^' as the container
	for a container.
	
	- fixed a bug where Tmojo would create a nasty file
	in the cache directory when you tried to call a directory
	as a template.

version: 0.250
date:    Mar 05, 2004
author:  Will Conant <will@lab-01.com>
changes:
	
	- added the ability to have tmojo code within perl
	sections without breaking the world. Specifically,
	you can now have a line that says <:method foo> in
	a perl section without actually creating a method.
	
	- added <:escape> sections that allow arbitrary
	tmojo code to pass through unevaluated.
	
	- both <:perl> and <:escape> sections support a user
	defined terminator, like this <:escape-sample> that
	allows </:perl> and </:escape> to appear within
	<:perl> and <:escape> sections withou exiting the
	section. Example
	  
	  <:escape-sample>
		This is an example escape:
		<:escape>
			: print "hello";
		</:escape>
	  </:escape-sample>
	  
	This is especially useful when outputting Tmojo documentation.
	In other words, it's a feature for me :)
	
	- Added <:capture> sections, which allow you to capture
	the Tmojo output of a block without automatically dumping
	that output to the $Result. Example:
	
	  <:capture my $captured>
		This text will end up in the lexical
		variable $captured and will not be
		automatically dumped to $Result.
	  </:capture>
	
	- Added <:filter> sections, which allow you to filter
	sections of Tmojo output before they are added to
	$Result. Example:
	
	  <:filter reverse($Result)>
		This text will end up being backwards!
	  </:filter>
	
	- Improved error checking for run-away sections and redeclared
	methods.

version: 0.200
date:    Mar 03, 2004
author:  Will Conant <will@lab-01.com>
changes:

	- added relative template referencing. For example,
	when a template refers to its container as
	'container.tmojo', that now refers to the
	'container.tmojo' in the same directory as the
	template. To refer to the top-most 'container.tmojo',
	prepend a '/' as in '/container.tmojo'.
	
	- added upward traversal in paths. For example, a
	template may now refer to its container as
	'container.tmojo^'. The up-carrot tells Tmojo to look
	up the entire directory path in search of someting
	named 'container.tmojo'. This also works with absolute
	paths, so '/dir1/dir2/container.tmojo^' will cause
	Tmojo to look first in '/dir1/dir2' then in '/dir1'
	then simply in '/' for a template called
	'container.tmojo'.
	
	- added suport for <:method> as an alternative to <:sub>
	
	- moved Lab01::Tmojo.pm to Lab01::Tmojo::Engine.pm
	
	It is important to note that when call_with_container
	is used, the container id is relative to the location
	of the called template. This is extremely useful,
	because it allows you to say:
	
	$Tmojo->call_with_container('/some/template/here.tmojo', 'container.tmojo^')
	
	in order to establish a default container mechanism
	(similar to the autohandler mechanism found in Mason)

version: 0.101
date:    Mar 01, 2004
author:  Will Conant <will@lab-01.com>
changes:

	- fixed bug where changes in parent template would not
	be noticed until child template was changed or the
	cache was flushed
	
	- fixed bug where line number comments where put in
	perl blocks containing multi-line leterals. decided to
	put line numbers in separate file from perl source.
